/**
 * This class provides a way for resources that are made with a try-with-resources block to escape from the

 * is an error during construction we want the resources to be closed correctly, but on success we do not want to close
 * those resources.
 *
 * @param <T> the type of AutoCloseable object that may be allowed to escape the try-with-resources block
 * @param <E> the type of Exception that is thrown by the close() method on the AutoCloseable object.
