/**
 * Annotation used to determine if a diagnostic service will be exposed or not through JMX.
 * <p>
 * By default, diagnostic services are private and not expose so this annotation is necessary
 * to get a service exposed.
 * <p>
 * Note: whether a diagnostic service is exposed or not through JMX, we will still have access
 * to it through the diagnostic service proxy mechanism.
 * <p>
 * This annotation only determines of the diagnostic service will also be made available in a
 * JMX console
 * <p>
 * You can also expose a service that is not annotated with {@link DiagnosticServicesRegistration}
