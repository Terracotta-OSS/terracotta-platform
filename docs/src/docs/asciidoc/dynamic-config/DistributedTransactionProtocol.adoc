= Dynamic Config: Distributed Transaction Protocol

== Objective

We need a protocol for how the cluster tool operation to make a configuration change will ensure that all servers either
make the change or do not make the change.

== Requirements

A server admin should not be required to always run the cluster tool from the same machine. In other words, the cluster
tool will not have persistent state about the progress of the protocol.

When cluster tool is run, it does not know if another cluster tool operation is underway at the same time.

If a cluster is left in an inconsistent state then a user should be able to run a cluster tool command to bring the
cluster back to a consistent state.

== Design

=== Overview

==== Mutative messages

Each server keeps a persistent count of how many mutative messages it has processed. A mutative message is a message
that in some way changes the state of the server. This allows the cluster tool to query the state of the server and then
tell the server to do something conditional on whether it still has the same mutative message count: the server's state
is guaranteed not to have changed in the meantime if the mutative message count has not changed.

Before a mutative message is processed, the expected mutative message count is compared to the server's
mutativeMessageCount. If they do not match the message is rejected.

When a mutative message is processed, the server's mutativeMessageCount is incremented. In addition, lastMutationHost
and lastMutationUser are set to the values sent in the mutative message.

==== Double discover

The protocol uses a discovery mechanism to establish the current state of the servers. Another cluster tool may be
altering the state of the cluster as this discovery mechanism runs, so the apparent results from the discovery may not
reflect a coherent state. This makes it hard for the cluster tool to decide on the appropriate course of action after a
single discovery.

If, however, after the first discovery is complete, a second round of discovery is performed and it returns the same
result as the first round of discovery (including matching mutative message counts), then the cluster tool can be
certain that the discovered cluster state actually existed at some point in time between the end of the first discovery
completing and the second discovery starting.

This, combined with the mutative message count check, allows predictable progress in the protocol.

If the second discovery returns a different result then the cluster tool can abort and report that it detected that
another cluster tool instance was concurrently performing operations.

==== Change request UUID

Every change request will have a UUID to identity itself. This helps to track which changes have been prepared or
committed, especially if two changes are attempted at the same time.

==== Timeouts

If, when the cluster tool sends a message to a server, the cluster tool does not receive a response then it will time
out after a fixed period. This potentially leaves the cluster in an inconsistent state, but the recovery process can be
used to handle this.

The timeout length should be controllable via cluster tool command line arguments, but it will default to 10 seconds.

==== Message ordering

Servers handle messages in this protocol serially.

=== Server states

All server protocol state is persisted.

The server has the following pieces of global state:

. mode - an enum representing the phase of the protocol. Either:
.. ACCEPTING: accepting change requests (i.e. the last change is committed or rolled back)
.. PREPARED: has an outstanding change request (i.e. is part way through the process of making a change)
. mutativeMessageCount - a monotonically increasing count of the number of mutative messages that have been processed by
this server.
. lastMutationHost - the name of the machine that hosted the cluster tool that sent the last mutative message.
. lastMutationUser - the name of the user that ran the cluster tool that sent the last mutative message.
. latestChange - the UUID of the most recent change request (whether prepared, committed or rolled back).
. currentVersion - the version number of the current active configuration.
. highestVersion - the highest version number seen by this server.

The server also has the following pieces of information for each change request, keyed by UUID:

. state - an enum representing the progress of this change request. Either:
.. PREPARED
.. COMMITTED
.. ROLLED_BACK
. version - the version number of the configuration that would result from committing the change.
. creationHost - the hostname of the machine on which the creating cluster tool instance is running.
. creationUser - the user as which the creating cluster tool instance is running.
. summary - a human-readable summary of the change

The server also holds the full configuration that would result from committing the change, keyed by version number.

=== Messages

==== Mutative messages

Mutative messages must include the following information:

. the expected mutative message count
. the name of the machine hosting the cluster tool that sends the message
. the name of the user running the cluster tool that sends the message

==== The change-discover message

A ```change-discover``` message contains no information.

This message is the only one that is not considered mutative.

When a server receives a ```change-discover``` message, it sends a response with the following information:

. mode
. mutativeMessageCount
. lastMutationHost
. lastMutationUser
. latestChange
. currentVersion
. highestVersion
. current active configuration
. The following information about the change request specified by latestChange:
.. state
.. version
.. details of the configuration represented by version.
.. creationHost
.. creationUser
.. summary

==== The change-prepare message

A ```change-prepare``` message contains:

. the UUID of the change request
. the version number for this change
. a human readable summary of the change (e.g. "Update offheap to 8GB")
. the details of the change (e.g. a full new configuration, a delta to the existing configuration or a previously
committed version number)
. the mutative message information

When a server receives a ```change-prepare``` message it:

. checks the server's mutative message count matches the expectations of the incoming message. If not, it responds to
the cluster tool, rejecting the change.
. checks to see that it would be able to apply the changes specified in the change request. If not, it responds to the
cluster tool, rejecting the change.
. uses the information contained in the ```change-prepare``` message to create a new change request within the server's
state, keyed by the change request UUID. The change request is in the PREPARED state.
. sets mode to PREPARED, latestChange to the change request UUID, highestVersion to the version in the message and
increments mutativeMessageCount.
. sets lastMutationHost and lastMutationUser based on the mutative message information
. responds to the cluster tool, accepting the change.

==== The change-commit message

A ```change-commit``` message contains:

. the UUID of the change request
. the mutative message information

When a server receives a ```change-commit``` message it:

. checks the server's mutative message count matches the expectations of the incoming message. If not, it responds to
the cluster tool, rejecting the commit.
. updates the change request to COMMITTED.
. sets mode to ACCEPTING, currentVersion to the version in the change and increments mutativeMessageCount.
. sets lastMutationHost and lastMutationUser based on the mutative message information.
. if a restart is not required for this configuration change then the server switches to the new configuration.
. responds to the cluster tool to say that the change is committed.

==== The change-rollback message

A ```change-rollback``` message contains:

. the UUID of the change request
. the mutative message information

When a server receives a ```change-rollback``` message it:

. checks the server's mutative message count matches the expectations of the incoming message. If not, it rejects the
rollback.
. updates the change request to ROLLED_BACK
. sets mode to ACCEPTING and increments mutativeMessageCount.
. sets lastMutationHost and lastMutationUser based on the mutative message information
. responds to the cluster tool to say that the change is rolled-back.

==== The change-takeover message

A ```change-takeover``` message contains:

. the mutative message information

When a server receives a ```change-takeover``` message it:

. checks the server's mutative message count matches the expectations of the incoming message. If not, it responds to
the cluster tool, rejecting the takeover.
. increments mutativeMessageCount.
. sets lastMutationHost and lastMutationUser based on the mutative message information
. responds to the cluster tool, accepting the takeover.

=== Main protocol sequence

In the simple case that everything works as expected, The following sequence of events would take place when making a
change:

. User runs the cluster tool command.
. Cluster tool queries the cluster to get the topology information.
. *PHASE 1*: Cluster tool sends a ```change-discover``` message to all servers
. Once the cluster tool receives responses from all servers it:
.. checks that all servers are in the ACCEPTING mode. If not, it stops.
.. sends a second ```change-discover``` message to all servers.
. Once the cluster tool receives responses from all servers to the second ```change-discover``` message it:
.. checks that all servers responded with a discovery response the second time that matches their first response,
including mutative message counts. If not it stops, reporting that another cluster tool is running.
.. asserts that all servers have the same currentVersion.
.. optionally checks with the user that currentVersion and the current configuration are as the user expected and gets a
go ahead from the user.
.. generates a UUID to identify the change.
.. informs the user of the UUID of the change and that the servers may now be in an inconsistent state, which may mean
that recovery is required if the cluster tool operation does not complete.
. *PHASE 2*: The cluster tool sends a ```change-prepare``` message to every server and waits for responses from all
servers. The version number used in the ```change-prepare``` message will be max(highestVersion) + 1.
. *PHASE 3*: The cluster tool checks that all servers have accepted the change request:
.. If they have, it sends a ```change-commit``` message to every server for the change.
.. If they have not, it sends a ```change-rollback``` message to every server that has accepted the change.
. Once the cluster tool receives responses from all servers to the commit / rollback message it:
.. checks that all servers have committed / rolled-back the change. If so it informs the user that the servers are once
again in a consistent state. And:
... For a commit: it informs the user that the change has been made successfully.
... For a rollback: it informs the user the the change could not be made and gives the reason why.
.. if one or more servers has failed to commit / roll-back the change, it informs the user that there's a problem that
requires intervention and recovery.

=== Recovery

The recovery process is as follows:

. The cluster tool sends a ```change-discover``` message to every server.
. Once the cluster tool receives responses from all servers it sends a second ```change-discover``` message to all
servers.
. Once the cluster tool receives responses from all servers to the second ```change-discover``` message then:
.. if there are two discovery responses from a server that do not match each other, then the cluster tool:
...  tells the user that another cluster tool is running and stops.
.. if every server is in the ACCEPTING mode, the cluster tool:
... asserts that all servers have the same currentVersion.
... informs the user that the cluster is consistent.
.. if one or more servers are in the PREPARED mode then:
... the cluster tool sends a ```change-takeover``` message to every server.
... the cluster tool checks that all servers accept the takeover.  If they do not, it tells the user that another
cluster tool is running and stops.
... if the servers have different values for their latestChange, then the cluster tool will send a ```change-rollback```
message to all servers in the PREPARED mode and, once the responses are processed, stop.
... the cluster tool asserts that it is not the case that the latestChange is COMMITTED on one server and ROLLED_BACK on
another.
... if one or more servers have the latestChange state as COMMITTED, the cluster tool will send a ```change-commit```
message to all servers in the PREPARED mode and, once the responses are processed, stop.
... if one or more servers have the latestChange state as ROLLED_BACK, the cluster tool will send a
 ```change-rollback``` message to all servers in the PREPARED mode and, once the responses are processed, stop.
... the cluster tool asserts that all servers are in the PREPARED mode.
... all servers will be told to roll back the change (although it would also be valid to choose to commit).
