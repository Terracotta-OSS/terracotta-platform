= Passive sync and append log repair

== Please read first

- Config-tool.adoc
- DistributedTransactionProtocol.adoc

== Summary of the behavior and tooling

=== ConfigHandlers

They are the implementations on server-side that are responsible to check if a change is possible and apply it at runtime if wanted.

One for each main component (node, offheap, data-root, etc).

. They have 2 methods:
.. `tryApply()` => check if the change can be applied to the topology, does all validation and checks.
Its goal is to make sure that if this method pass, then the `apply()` method won't fail
.. `apply()` => applies the change *at runtime* (only if it needs to be applied at runtime).
This method should not fail, and this is ensured by `tryApply()`.
But this method could still fail...

=== CLI `set`, `unset`

. CLI: User runs `config-tool set foo=bar`
. DISCOVERY: Nomad triggers a first discovery
.. If at least one server cannot accept a new change => fails
. DISCOVERY: Nomad triggers a second discovery
.. If the first and second discovery answers do not match => fails (a change or something might have happened between the 2 consecutive calls)
.. If there is a version mismatch => fails
.. If a change UUID is both committed on some servers and rolled-back on some others => fails
. PREPARE: Nomad triggers the preparation of the change
.. Servers are called to determine if the change can be applied (`tryApply` method of config handlers)
.. Servers are called in order: passive firsts, active last
.. If the change was not rejected, a new configuration version is written on disk
. Nomad checks if all servers have accepted the change
.. ROLLBACK: If at least one server rejects or if a failure happens, an automatic rollback happens
. COMMIT: Nomad triggers the commit of the change if all servers have accepted it
.. Servers are optionally calling the `apply` method of the config handlers to apply the change at runtime.
.. Since `tryApply` succeeded, `apply` _should_ pass.
.. If an error happens, Nomad fails to commit, does not accept further changes until is is repaired (recovery process)

=== CLI `diagnostic`

. Outputs details information about the config, Nomad and states of all servers

=== CLI `repair`

. Tries to repair a broken configuration "state"
. If a Nomad change is partially committed (or rolled back), try to run again the commit (or rollback) phase again

It can happen that the automatic repair is not able to determine what to do.
This can happen if some nodes are offline, and all remaining online servers are all prepared.
In this case, a hint must be given to the CLI to force either the commit or rollback

  @Override
  public boolean shouldDoCommit() {
    return latestChangeUuids.size() == 1 // online servers all have the same change UUID at the end of the append log
        && rolledBack.get() == 0 // AND we have no server online having rolled back this change
        && prepared.get() > 0 // AND we have some servers online that are still prepared
        && (prepared.get() + committed.get() == expectedNodeCount // AND we have all the nodes that are online and they are all either prepared or committed
        || committed.get() > 0 // OR we have some nodes offline, but amongst the online nodes, some are committed, so we can commit
        || committed.get() == 0 && forcedState == COMMITTED // OR we have some nodes offline, but amongst the online ones none are committed (they are all prepared), but user says he wants to force a commit
    );
  }

  @Override
  public boolean shouldDoRollback() {
    return latestChangeUuids.size() == 1 // online servers all have the same change UUID at the end of the append log
        && committed.get() == 0 // AND we have no server online having committed this change
        && prepared.get() > 0 // AND we have some servers online that are still prepared
        && (prepared.get() + rolledBack.get() == expectedNodeCount // AND we have all the nodes that are online and they are all either prepared or rolled back
        || rolledBack.get() > 0 // OR we have some nodes offline, but amongst the online nodes, some are rolled back, so we can rollback the prepared ones
        || rolledBack.get() == 0 && forcedState == ROLLED_BACK // OR we have some nodes offline, but amongst the online ones none are rolled back (they are all prepared), but user says he wants to force a rollback
    );
  }

[NOTE]
====
This command will likely be enough and cover 80% of the failures and will make sure all the nodes have their configuration committed and applied at runtime (if needed) and to repair.
====

=== Passive `sync`

. If the active is in PREPARED state (change in progress) => fails to start (zap)
. If the history does not match => fails
. If the last passive change is PREPARED, apply the commit (or rollback) phase by looking at the active log.
The passive will repair itself during sync process.
. Then get the new changes from the active and apply them

=== Startup

A node starts with the last committed config.
A Node will start even if its last append log entry is PREPARED.

. If it become ACTIVE, the node can be repaired automatically to apply the new config by using the `repair` command
. If it become PASSIVE, the node will sync with existing ACTIVE, repair itself if the ACTIVE is OK, or zap itself if the ACTIVE is PREPARED

=== `TopologyService`

The `TopologyService` contains some methods that can be queried on client-side and server-side to know the state of a node:

- `TopologyService#mustBeRestarted()`: indicates if a node must be restarted to activate its new configuration
- `TopologyService#hasPreparedConfigurationChange()`: indicates if a node is having a PREPARED change that is not finalized.
In this state, not further change will be possible until it is committed or rolled back

== Failure Scenarios:

=== Partial commit and `apply` method

A partial commit can happen in case of timeouts, server crash, or if the `apply` method fails (in the case where we apply the change at runtime).

We have an `apply` implementation for the settings that can be changed at runtime like offheap, data root, node backup, lease, etc.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, the `apply` code is quite robust: if `tryApply` succeeds, then likely `apply` will succeed except in case of an external cause (i.e. disk full, i/o error, etc).
====

=== Situation 1

- 1 cluster of 1 server
- The config change on active is not committed because of a network timeout

=> Run `config-tool repair` to re-apply the missing commit or rollback

=== Situation 2

- 1 cluster of 1 server
- The config change on active is not committed because of a bug in the `apply` method

=> Run `config-tool repair` to check the configuration.
It will try to re-apply the commit or rollback, but it will fail again.
A patch is needed at the moment.

[NOTE]
====
Do we want a mechanism to fix that without requiring a patch, such as being able to force a commit or rollback ?
====

=== Situation 3

- 1 cluster of 1 server
- The config change on active is not committed because of a crash
- server is restarted (last change is PREPARED)

=> Run `config-tool repair` to check the configuration and re-apply the commit or rollback

=== Situation 4

- 1 cluster of 1 stripe 2 nodes up
- commit fails on active, not on passive
- passive is killed by user or crashes, and is restarted
- passive cannot start (zapped) because its history is different

=> Run `config-tool repair` to check the configuration at any time and re-apply the missing commit or rollback

=== Situation 5

- 1 cluster of 1 stripe 2 nodes
- passive is down
- commit fails on active
- passive cannot start (zapped) until active is repaired

=> Run `config-tool repair` to check the configuration and re-apply the missing commit or rollback

=== Situation 6

- 1 cluster of 1 stripe 2 nodes up
- commit fails on passive, not on active
- passive is killed by user or crashes, and is restarted
- passive wil start, sync, see that the PREPARED change it has has been committed on active and will repair itself and restart
