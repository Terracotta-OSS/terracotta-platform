= Dynamic Config: Storing Cluster Information

== Objective

Currently we store information about the cluster in the TopologyEntity. This information needs to be managed in the same
way as the other configuration information: versioned and updated atomically across the cluster.

== Requirements

=== Topology entity
All information currently held in the TopologyEntity must be persisted using the configuration repository. This includes
which servers exist, how those servers comprise stripes and the configuration of each stripe in the cluster.

=== User controllable strings
Some configuration options include user controllable strings. For example, a user can define the name of an offheap
resource and then configure that offheap resource, controlling its size. A concrete example would be a user configuring
a ```finance``` offheap then the configuration could logically be considered as:

 offheap.finance.size=8589934592

However, such a dot separated key space will not work because the user controllable strings could include dots.
Similarly users may use other control symbols or whitespace, which can cause problems for some forms of persistence
(such as using attribute values or element names in XML).

=== Reconstruct configuration

It must be possible to reconstruct the configuration for a server from the cluster information held on another server in
the cluster.

== Design

=== Persistance location

The cluster configuration will appear as a ```<plugins>/<config>``` element in the ```tc-config.xml``` file.

=== XML structure

The cluster configuration will be stored in an XML structure that looks like this:

[source,xml]
----
<cluster>
  <name>My Cluster</name>

  <server>
    <name>server-1-1</name>
    <tc-config>
      ...tc-config for server-1-1
    </tc-config>
  </server>
  <server>
    <name>server-1-2</name>
    <tc-config>
      ...tc-config for server-1-2
    </tc-config>
  </server>
  <server>
    <name>server-2-1</name>
    <tc-config>
      ...tc-config for server-2-1
    </tc-config>
  </server>
  <server>
    <name>server-2-2</name>
    <tc-config>
      ...tc-config for server-2-2
    </tc-config>
  </server>

  <stripe>
    <name>stripe-1</name>
    <member>server-1-1</member>
    <member>server-1-2</member>
  </stripe>
  <stripe>
    <name>stripe-2</name>
    <member>server-2-1</member>
    <member>server-2-2</member>
  </stripe>
</cluster>
----

=== XML namespaces

The XML elements that comprise the cluster configuration will use the namespace
http://www.terracotta.org/config/cluster.

The ```tc-config``` element shown in the example will use the http://www.terracotta.org/config namespace. This matches
the normal namespace used for a ```tc-config``` element that would appear at the top level of a ```tc-config.xml```
file.

=== Copy of tc-config

The ```<cluster>/<server>``` elements contain a copy of the ```tc-config.xml``` file for each server. However, the
 ```<config>/<cluster>``` element is not included in that. If a full version of another server's ```tc-config.xml```
file needs to be created, a copy of the ```<config>/<cluster>``` element can be inserted. It's rather quine-like.
